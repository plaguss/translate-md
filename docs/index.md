> This project was developed for my personal use: translating markdown files from my blog posts. It may be useful for somebody (I would be honored to listen to that), but is not the target necessarily.

Anyway, the API is not expected to change unless some extra feature is required. Contributions are welcome!

To see the features along some examples, please visit the docs.

## üîß Installation

```console
pip install translate-md
```

This client depends on a service which is currently expected tu run locally. You would need to get it to work:

### Additional dependencies

You will need [spanglish](https://github.com/plaguss/spanglish) running in order to start working. The easiest way is to clone the repo and use docker for it. Get the service up you should be ready to go.

## üìù Documentation

TBD

The [documentation](https://plaguss.github.io/translate-md/) is made with [Material for MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) and is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).
